# FizzbuzzJudge

This repository was created to make Ruby Gem

So, the code is very poor. :D

([FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is very basic for beginner of programming.)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fizzbuzz_judge', github: gouf/fizzbuzz_judge
```

And then execute:

## Usage

FizzbuzzJudge.fizz?(number) # => true
```

Also it available `buzz?(number)`, `fizzbuzz?(number)`.
